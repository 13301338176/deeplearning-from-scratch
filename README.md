# Deep Python Scratch :computer::thinking::snake:

Repositório com código para o tutorial Aprendendo Deep Learning. Contribuições são muito bem vindas!

----

A repository with neural networks and deep learning related concepts fully implemented in Jupyter notebooks using a Python 3 kernel. The code here available was developed only for learning and teaching purposes. But is not in the best shape and structure for real use. Also, all comments and instructions are in Portuguese mainly because there's already a lot of good content in English.

Feel free to use this for any project or work using the Apache 2.0 LICENSE.
